            <p>Few months ago, a piece of tragic news caught all tech industry related students and workers’ attention: one of the employees of Facebook, Qin Chen committed suicide after work at Facebook, Menlo Park headquarters. It is a heart-breaking news to us, as we all have a large number of friends and families who work at those highly competitive tech companies. From the news, we learned that Qin was under a huge pressure at work, and it is not avoidable in those highly competitive companies. Thus, mental health quality and pressure relief methodologies brought us attention. </p>
            <p>To keep a healthy mental state is always an incredible part of people’s well-being, and there are many ways to relieve stress. Thinking of this, theaters come to our mind. Theaters are one of the places that people choose to go in their leisure time because movies and stage shows can provide an escape from reality easily. Based on the research paper by Grace Jennings-Edquist, watching movies can not only help people process difficult life lessons but can also relax people’s brains. </p>
            <p>Combined thoughts, this research project is focusing on the geographical locations of theaters, populations, and the distribution of hardest-working cities in the US. Do people who work hard, who have higher working pressure have more access to theaters? What is the quality of those theaters at those cities, which considered ‘competitive’? What are the affecting factors of the reviews? Will different levels of workload affect the way people leave comments? </p>
            <p>By conducting this research and analysis, we also using theater as a representing feature of the stress-relief strategies people took. So in other words, do people who live in the hardest-work cities have a proper and sufficient amount of access to leisure facilities? We conduct this research from a different angle as the researches did before about pressure relief. We would like to know and analysis that for those people who live in a competitive city, do they have enough places to go when they are free, and does the living environment for those who work hard is actually more stressful compared to those who live in the cities which are not labeled as hard-work. </p>
