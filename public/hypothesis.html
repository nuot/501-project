                            <p>We want to further explore the relationship between people working load and their
                                evaluation to local theaters. Based on the top 100 hard working city rank, all the
                                ranked cities were grouped to three categories: Working extremely hard, Working very
                                hard and Working hard.</p>

                                        <script data-plotly="Yanou_Yang:30" src="https://plot.ly/embed.js" async></script>

                            <p>From the Boxplot, it’s not hard to find that working hard cities’s theater rating is
                                generally lower than the other two groups. But we can not make deeper conclusion about
                                if there are any difference between working extremely hard cities’ theater rating and
                                working very hard cities’. Therefore, for detail information, we applied T test to help
                                us figure out. </p>
                            <h8>H0: People living in working extremely hard cities have the same attitude towards local
                                theater with people living in working very hard cities.</h8>
                            <br>
                            <h8>H1: People living in working extremely hard cities tend to be more satisfied with local
                                theater compared to who living in working very hard cities.</h8>
                            <p>Since the P Value equals 0.0102, which is less than significant level 0.05, we reject the
                                null hypothesis. Thus, there is enough evidence to conclude that there is a significant
                                difference between two group cities’ theaters’ rating.Taking the boxplot into
                                consideration, we can reach out a very interesting conclusion, that people living in
                                more heavy working load cities tends to give local theater a higher rate.

                                <p>From the analysis above, we learn that workload can influence theaters overall
                                    rating, but what makes this phenomenon happens?

                                    In order to solve this question, our team take state median average income, the
                                    state popula-tion, theater average review counts into consideration, because income
                                    and population might have a relationship with the population diversity and the
                                    ability to afford entertainment.
                                </p>

                                <h8>H0: Population, state’s median average income and review count together contribute
                                    to each state average theater rating.

                                </h8>
                                <br>
                                <h8>H1: State average theater rating has nothing to do with the combination of
                                    population, state’s median average income and review count. </h8>

                                <p>From the review counts and rating boxplot, we can see that less number reviewsinduce
                                    some extreme case like rating 1 or 5, and the more reviews the average the rating
                                    tends to be. </p>

                                <p>Besides, from the graph we can see, it’s obviously that with the number of reviews in-crease, the rating close to 3.5 and become more stable. Therefore, we consider review counts as an important variable in analyzing rating.</p>
                                <p>Since there are over two input factors, we apply linear regression to do this statistical test. The summary of the test shows as follows.</p>

                                <img id="hyp1" src="./pic/hy1.png" alt="Picture not found"></center>
                                <p>From the summary of the result, we can see that the r-square is too low to consider lin-ear regression model is a good fit of the data. Besides, we find among three input fac-tors, only review count’s P Value is less than 0.05, which indicates among three factors only review count has statistical significant relationship with rating. As a consequence, the assumption ahead wasn’t supported by the dataset we have right now. </p>
